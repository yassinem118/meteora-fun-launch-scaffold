## Alpha Vault — `@meteora-ag/alpha-vault@1.1.16`

Program `vaU6kP7iNEGkbmPkLmZfGwiGxd4Mob24QQCie5R9kd2` (mainnet + devnet; **exported as a string
keyed by cluster, not PublicKey**). Enums: `PoolType { DLMM=0, DAMM=1, DAMMV2=2 }`,
`VaultMode { PRORATA=0, FCFS=1 }`, `VaultState { PREPARING..ENDED }`.

**Verify a vault (BUILD path — the ACT path is `alpha-vault-get-status`, below):**

```ts
import AlphaVault from '@meteora-ag/alpha-vault';
// Given only the POOL address there is no pure PDA derivation (the 'base' seed is the
// creator or config, not the pool). Find the vault by scanning:
const accounts = await connection.getProgramAccounts(new PublicKey(ALPHA_VAULT_PROGRAM_ID), {
  filters: [{ memcmp: { offset: 8, bytes: poolAddress.toBase58() } }], // Vault.pool is the first field
});
const av = await AlphaVault.create(connection, accounts[0].pubkey);
// Gotcha: a nonexistent vault address makes AlphaVault.create read `.data` off a null
// getMultipleAccountsInfo result with no guard — a raw TypeError, not an actionable message
// The studio's own loadAlphaVault wraps this into a
// clean "No alpha vault at ..." error — see alpha_vault/utils.ts if calling AlphaVault.create
// directly.
// av.vault (state), av.mode (VaultMode), av.vaultState (lifecycle phase)
const escrow = await av.getEscrow(userPubkey);
const state = await av.interactionState(escrow); // { depositInfo, claimInfo, availableQuota,
//   canDeposit, canClaim, canWithdraw, ... }
```

User ops (all → `Transaction`): `deposit(maxAmount, owner, merkleProof?)`, `withdraw`,
`withdrawRemainingQuote`, `claimToken`, `closeEscrow`. Crank: `fillVault(payer)` — loop until it
returns null. `getMerkleProofForDeposit(owner)` fetches a permissioned vault's proof from Meteora's
proof API and can return null (not on the whitelist yet, or no proof published). Gotcha: the package
bundles a second Anchor 0.28 copy for its DLMM/DAMM v1 programs.

Studio actions: `alpha-vault-*` (create + deposit/withdraw/claim/crank/status) — see
`studio-actions.md`. `alpha-vault-get-status` is now the ACT-path verification call (no BUILD-side
code needed just to check a vault's state).

## Presale Vault — `@meteora-ag/presale@0.1.1`

Program `presSVxnf9UU8jMxhgSMqaRwNiT36qeBdNeTRKjTdbj` (the src IDL in the repo shows a different,
non-deployed address — trust PRESALE_PROGRAM_ID from the package). **Pre-1.0 — expect churn.** Since
0.0.5: `presaleArgs` gained required `disableEarlierPresaleEndOnceCapReached` (keep FCFS/fixed-price
running until end time even after the cap is hit) and `lockedVestingArgs` gained required
`immediateReleaseTimestamp` (when the immediate-release portion unlocks — the SDK's examples default
it to `presaleEndTime`); fixed-price creates take `disableWithdraw`. New helpers:
`getOnChainTimestamp(connection)`, `calculateLockAndVestDurationFromTimestamps(...)`,
`getRegistryRemainingDepositQuota` on the wrapper, and a max-presale-cap calculator;
`getPendingClaimable{Raw,Ui}Amount` now REQUIRE a `currentTimestamp` argument.

```ts
import { Presale, derivePresale } from '@meteora-ag/presale';
const presaleAddress = derivePresale(baseMint, quoteMint, base, PRESALE_PROGRAM_ID); // seeds ["presale", base, mint, quote]
const presale = await Presale.create(connection, presaleAddress);
const w = presale.getParsedPresale(); // PresaleWrapper:
// w.getPresaleProgressState()  -> NotStarted|Ongoing|Completed|Failed
// w.getPresaleProgressPercentage(), w.getTotalDepositUiAmount(), w.getAverageTokenPrice()
// w.canDeposit()/canWithdraw()/canClaim()/canCreatorWithdraw()
const escrows = await presale.getPresaleEscrowByOwner(buyer); // per-buyer state
```

Buyer lifecycle (instance methods → `Transaction`): `deposit({ owner, amount, registryIndex? })` →
(after end) `claim({ owner, registryIndex })` / `withdrawRemainingQuote` /
`closeEscrow({ owner, registryIndex })` (reclaims escrow rent once eligible). `deposit()` itself
creates a missing buyer escrow as a bundled pre-instruction in the SAME transaction for
permissionless (`getOrCreatePermissionlessEscrowIx`) and permissioned_with_merkle_proof
(`getOrCreatePermissionedEscrowWithMerkleProofIx`) whitelist modes — calling
`createPermissionlessEscrow`/`createPermissionedEscrowWithMerkleProof` yourself first is unnecessary
and would just cost an extra transaction. `EscrowWrapper.canClose(presaleWrapper)` gates whether
`closeEscrow` will succeed: Ongoing/Failed escrows need their deposit (and any fee) already at zero;
Completed escrows need everything allocated to them already claimed (and, for prorata, any remaining
quote already withdrawn). Creator: `creatorWithdraw`, `creatorCollectFee`,
`performUnsoldBaseTokenAction`. Gotchas: `registryIndex` is a BN serialized as **u8**; a
permissionless presale's escrow-creation instruction can only ever create a wallet's FIRST escrow at
registry 0 — its on-chain PDA seeds hardcode that byte rather than taking it as an instruction arg —
so a first-time deposit into a nonzero registry on a permissionless presale has no automatic
escrow-creation path.

Studio actions: `presale-vault-*` (create + full buyer/creator lifecycle + status) — see
`studio-actions.md`.

**Finding a presale:** there is no REST endpoint for presales today (unlike Pool Farms'
`amm.meteora.ag` lookup, below). ACT path: `pnpm studio presale-vault-get-status --baseMint <mint>`
— discovery mode that scans every presale and filters by base mint, printing the match (or a
`pubkey | mode | progress` list if the mint has more than one). BUILD path:
`Presale.getPresales(connection)` returns every presale account on the program (a full
`getProgramAccounts` scan — there's no memcmp/PDA shortcut from just the mint); filter the results'
`.account.baseMint` yourself.

## Stake2Earn (M3M3) — `@meteora-ag/m3m3@1.0.10`

Program `FEESngU3neckdwib9X3KWqdL7Mjmqk9XNp3uh5JbP4KP`. DAMM v1 pools only. **Anchor 0.29.**

```ts
import StakeForFee from '@meteora-ag/m3m3';
const s4f = await StakeForFee.create(connection, poolAddress); // derives the fee vault from the pool
const { stakeEscrow, unclaimFee } = await s4f.getUserStakeAndClaimBalance(user);
// stakeEscrow.stakeAmount, .inTopList, unclaimFee.feeA/.feeB — the farm verification call
```

User ops: `initializeStakeEscrow(owner)` → `stake(maxAmount, owner)` → `claimFee(owner, maxFee)` ·
`unstake(amount, unstakeKey, owner)` → `withdraw(unstakeKey, owner)`. Admin:
`StakeForFee.createFeeVault(...)` (what the studio's stake2earn actions wrap).

Studio actions: `stake2earn-*` (farm create + lock via `damm-v1-*`, full staker lifecycle + status)
— see `studio-actions.md`.

**Finding a farm:** SDK static `StakeForFee.getAllFeeVault(connection)` returns every fee vault on
the program as `{ publicKey, account }[]`, with `account.pool` and `account.stakeMint` among the
decoded fields — filter by either to find a farm, then run
`stake2earn-get-status --poolAddress <pool>`. Heuristic for which pools have one at all: M3M3 farms
sit on DAMM v1 memecoin pools (`is_meme: true` in `damm-api.meteora.ag` pool search results — see
`data-and-apis.md`).

## Zap — `@meteora-ag/zap-sdk@1.3.2`

Program `zapvX9M3uf5pvy4wRPAbQgdQsM1xmuiFnkfHKPvwMiz`. Single-token in/out of DAMM v2 and DLMM
positions. `new Zap(connection, { jupiterApiUrl?, jupiterApiKey? })` — one config object (the
README's 3-arg example is stale); both fields are optional — the SDK defaults to Jupiter's own
keyless endpoint (`https://api.jup.ag`) at a shared, low rate limit, an API key
(`https://developers.jup.ag/portal`) only raises it. Two-phase:
`getZapInDammV2DirectPoolParams(...)` → `buildZapInDammV2Transaction(...)`; same for DLMM
(`...Dlmm...`); `zapOut*` variants; also `rebalanceDlmmPosition(params)`. DLMM zap-in's own
`estimateDlmmDirectSwap` unconditionally calls Jupiter's quote API to price its rebalancing swap —
DAMM v2's direct route never touches Jupiter (see `studio-actions.md`'s Zap section). Build results
are **multi-transaction bundles** (`setupTransaction`, `swapTransactions[]`, `zapInTransaction`,
`cleanUpTransaction`) — send in order.

Two gotchas found by testing zap-in on localnet, both worth knowing before you build on this SDK.
First, keep `zapInTransaction` **alone in its own transaction** — that separate response field is a
requirement, not a size convenience. The zap program swaps by CPI into cp-amm, and merging that
instruction with others trips cp-amm's single-swap validation. Second, **a Rate-Limiter-fee-mode
DAMM v2 pool cannot be zapped into at all**: it fails on-chain with cp-amm error 6049
(`FailToValidateSingleSwapInstruction`) even when the zap-in instruction is completely alone. Since
a fresh pool created from `damm_v2_config.jsonc`'s defaults uses that fee mode, check the pool's
base-fee mode before you attempt a zap — decode it from the pool state with cp-amm's
`getBaseFeeHandlerFromBorshData` (the mode is Borsh-packed inside
`poolFees.baseFee.baseFeeInfo.data`, not a plain field) and compare against `FeeRateLimiter`.

Studio actions: `zap-in-damm-v2` (direct), `zap-in-dlmm` (Jupiter-quoted), `zap-out` (direct) — see
`studio-actions.md`.

## Dynamic Vault — `@meteora-ag/vault-sdk@2.3.1`

Program `24Uqj9JCLxUeoC3hGfh5W3s9FM9uCHDS2SG3LYwBpyTi`. The yield layer under DAMM v1 pool reserves.
**Anchor 0.28, oldest stack.** `VaultImpl.create(connection, tokenMint)` (keys off the TOKEN MINT,
not a vault address) → `getUserBalance(owner)`, `getVaultSupply()`, `getWithdrawableAmount()`; ops
`deposit(owner, amount)` / `withdraw(owner, amount)`. DAMM v1's `AmmImpl` already exposes these
per-pool as `pool.vaultA` / `pool.vaultB`. Gotcha: `withdraw`'s second parameter is misleadingly
named `baseTokenAmount` in the `.d.ts` — verified against the compiled source + vault program IDL,
it actually burns **vault LP tokens** (`unmintAmount`), not base-mint units; convert with the
exported `getAmountByShare` / `getUnmintAmount` helpers.

Studio actions: `vault-*` — see `studio-actions.md`.

## Dynamic Fee Sharing — `@meteora-ag/dynamic-fee-sharing-sdk@1.1.0`

Program `dfsdo2UqvwfN8DuUVrMRNfQe11VaiNoKcMqLHVvDPzh`. Splits fees among fixed recipients.
`new DynamicFeeSharingClient(connection, commitment)` → `getFeeBreakdown(feeVault)` →
`{ totalFundedFee, totalClaimedFee, totalUnclaimedFee, userFees[] }`;
`getRecipientDfsVault(recipient)` (reverse lookup). Create: `createFeeVault(params)`. Funding
bridges pull straight from other protocols: `fundByClaimDammV2Fee`,
`fundByClaimDbcCreatorTradingFee2` / `...PartnerTradingFee2` (use the `2` variants),
`fundByWithdrawDbcMigrationFee`. User claim: `claimUserFee2({ feeVault, user, payer, receiver })`.
Gotcha: ESM-first package (`"type": "module"` with a `.cjs` fallback).

Studio actions: `fee-sharing-*` — see `studio-actions.md`.

## Met Lock — `@meteora-ag/met-lock-sdk@1.0.1`

Program `LocpQgucEQHbqNABEYvBvwoxCPsSbG91A1QaQhQQqjn`. Standalone vesting/lock escrows for any SPL
or Token-2022 mint — not coupled to any pool. Anchor 0.31. **`docs.md` (320 ln) has real errors —
don't trust it over source/dist:** its `createVestingEscrowMetadata` "Example" block actually calls
`client.claimV2(...)` (wrong function, right-looking params), its `createVestingEscrowV2` "Notes"
require a `feeVault` signer copy-pasted from a different SDK (met-lock has no such concept), and it
documents `deriveEscrow`/`deriveEscrowMetadata` as `async client.deriveEscrow(...)` methods when
they're actually synchronous, standalone helper functions exported from the package. Mirror the SDK
repo's own `createVestingEscrowV2.s.ts` / `claimV2.s.ts` scripts instead.

```ts
import {
  LockClient,
  deriveEscrow,
  calculateTotalLockedVestingAmount,
} from '@meteora-ag/met-lock-sdk';
const client = new LockClient(connection, commitment); // commitment is REQUIRED, no default
const escrow = deriveEscrow(base.publicKey); // sync PDA helper, NOT a client method
const escrowState = await client.getEscrow(escrow); // THROWS (doesn't return null) if missing
```

`LockClient`'s full surface is 5 methods: `getRootEscrow(rootEscrow)` / `getEscrow(escrow)` (both
throw on a missing account), `createVestingEscrowMetadata(params)` (signers `[creator, payer]`),
`createVestingEscrowV2(params)` (signers `[sender, base, payer]` — `base` is a fresh `Keypair` whose
public key derives the escrow address), `claimV2(params)` (signers `[payer, recipient]`; the program
caps `maxAmount` at what has actually vested, so u64::MAX means "claim everything"). PDA helpers are
plain functions, not client methods: `deriveEscrow(base)`, `deriveEscrowMetadata(escrow)`,
`deriveRootEscrow(base, mint, version)`, `deriveBase(rootEscrow, recipient)`. Token-2022 is detected
by the caller, not the SDK: pass the mint's actual owner program as `tokenProgram`, and import
`TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID` from the same `@solana/spl-token` install the SDK resolves —
`createVestingEscrowV2` branches on it with `==` (object identity, not `.equals()`). Helper
`calculateTotalLockedVestingAmount( cliffUnlockAmount, amountPerPeriod, numberOfPeriod)` pre-checks
a sender's balance before creating an escrow. Owner→escrow listing has no SDK helper: use
`client.program.account.vestingEscrow.all()` with a memcmp filter (offset 8 = recipient, offset 72 =
creator).

**Not exposed: cancel / update-recipient.** The 5 methods listed above are `LockClient`'s entire
surface — there is no `cancelVestingEscrow` or update-recipient wrapper. Exposing either would mean
hand-rolling a raw `program.methods.cancelVestingEscrow(...)` /
`program.methods.updateVestingEscrowRecipient(...)` write call directly off the exported IDL, the
same class of gap as Pool Farms' `farm-create` below — deliberately out of scope here, so no
`lock-*` action can cancel a vesting escrow or change its recipient. This doesn't mean the settings
are inert: `cancelMode` / `updateRecipientMode` (`lock_config.jsonc`'s `lockCreateEscrow.cancelMode`
/ `updateRecipientMode`) ARE recorded on-chain at `createVestingEscrowV2` time either way, for OTHER
clients (the SDK repo's own scripts, a future studio addition, or any other `program.methods`
caller) to act on later — this CLI just has no action that reads them back out.

Studio actions: `lock-*` — see `studio-actions.md`.

## Pool Farms — `@meteora-ag/farming-sdk@1.0.18`

Program `FarmuwXPWXvefWUeqFAa5w6rifLkq5X6E8bimYvrhCB1`. DAMM v1 LP staking/reward farms — every
farm's `stakingMint` is a DAMM v1 pool's LP mint; no DAMM v2/DLMM equivalent exists. **Anchor 0.28
pinned**, and `@solana/web3.js` pinned to `~1.78.3` — the narrowest version pin of any Meteora SDK
in this studio. Left as-is, that pin forces an isolated, non-deduped `@solana/web3.js` install whose
own `rpc-websockets` dependency collides with the newer one the rest of the workspace hoists,
crashing on the package's very first `import` with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` (reproduced on
both Node 22 and 24) — this repo works around it with a root `pnpm.overrides` entry,
`"@meteora-ag/farming-sdk>@solana/web3.js": "^1.98.4"` (`package.json`), deduping the SDK onto the
same `@solana/web3.js` install every other SDK here already uses safely. A side effect:
`PublicKey`/`Transaction`/`BN` values now round-trip through this SDK's public API without needing
`as any` boundary casts — `studio/src/lib/farming` has none.

```ts
import { PoolFarmImpl } from '@meteora-ag/farming-sdk';
const farm = await PoolFarmImpl.create(connection, farmAddress); // no wallet — build-tx only
farm.poolState; // stakingMint, rewardAMint/rewardBMint, paused, totalStaked, rewardDuration(End), ...
```

User ops (all → a single `Transaction`, with `feePayer` and a `"finalized"`-commitment blockhash
already set by the SDK — refresh both right before sending anyway): `deposit(owner, amount: BN)`
(auto-creates the `user` account inline on first stake), `withdraw(owner, amount: BN)`,
`claim(owner)`. Static `claimAll(connection, owner, farmAddresses, opt?)` → `Transaction[]`, chunked
2 farms per tx (`MAX_CLAIM_ALL_ALLOWED`) — wrapped by the studio's `farm-claim-all` action
(config-driven farm list; each chunk claims a disjoint set of farms, so unlike a crank loop the
chunks don't depend on one another and can each be simulated/sent independently). Despite the
parameter being named `farmMints` throughout this SDK (`getUserBalances`, `getClaimableRewards`,
`claimAll`), it is actually an array of **farm addresses** (it feeds straight into
`program.account.pool.fetchMultiple`), never staking-mint/LP addresses.

**Two read bugs — do not call either directly:**

- `getUserBalance(owner)` does `fetchNullable(pda).balanceStaked` with no null guard — throws a raw
  `TypeError` for any wallet that has never staked in the farm.
- `getUserState(owner)` derives the correct `user` PDA via its own (correct, public)
  `getUserPda(owner)` and then ignores it, fetching `owner` — the wallet address — instead. It reads
  the wrong account entirely, silently returning null/garbage even for an active staker.

Safe replacement (what every `farm-*` studio action uses): call the SDK's own `getUserPda(owner)`
yourself, then read that PDA directly off the farm's Anchor `program` — marked `private` in the
`.d.ts`, so reaching it needs an `as any` cast (same boundary-cast convention used elsewhere in this
studio for reaching across an SDK's own version/internals boundary). The static
`getClaimableRewards(owner, farmAddresses, connection)` → `Map<farmAddressB58, {rewardA, rewardB}>`
is itself null-safe for a never-staked wallet (it just omits that farm from the returned map) and is
the right way to compute claimable rewards. It deep-imports `chunkedGetMultipleAccountInfos` from
`@meteora-ag/dynamic-amm-sdk/dist/cjs/src/amm/utils` at runtime — an undeclared peer dependency this
package never lists in its own `package.json` — but studio already depends on
`@meteora-ag/dynamic-amm-sdk` directly, so it resolves and the package imports cleanly, including
this deep path.

**Caution — the REST `farming_pool` field can be stale:** `damm-api.meteora.ag/farms`'s
`farming_pool` value for a pool can point to a DIFFERENT (older) farm account than what the CLI
resolves. Pool `7TY9HFLwy8BpS1sGNzYt281YY9WP4V1TzKcYbYft5SD1` returns two distinct farm accounts
with different reward-end timestamps). Trust the CLI's resolution
(`farm-get-status --poolAddress ...`); treat the REST field as advisory, not authoritative.

Farm discovery: `getFarmAddressesByPoolAddress(poolAddress, cluster?)` /
`getFarmAddressesByLp(lpAddress, cluster?)` → `{farmAddress, APY, expired}[]` are **REST calls** to
`amm.meteora.ag` (mainnet) or a devnet mirror — there is no on-chain PDA derivation from just the
pool, and `FARMING_API_ENDPOINT` has no `localhost` entry at all, so these always fail on a local
validator or offline. Both THROW (never return an empty array) when the API is unreachable or has
nothing for that pool/LP — catch and degrade to asking for the farm address directly instead of
surfacing the raw exception.

Farm creation is **not wrapped by the SDK** — `initializePool` / `fund` / `authorizeFunder` would
need to be called directly off the exported `IDL`, with the `pool`/vault PDAs self-derived (seeds
aren't part of this older Anchor 0.28 IDL's client metadata — the only reference for them is the
program's Rust CLI, not this SDK or its `.d.ts`). Deliberately out of scope here — no studio action
wraps it.

Studio actions: `farm-*` (stake/unstake/claim/status) — see `studio-actions.md`.
