# Meteora

Meteora is Solana's liquidity layer: bonding-curve token launches (DBC), constant-product AMMs (DAMM
v1/v2), bin-based concentrated liquidity with limit orders (DLMM), plus launch vaults. This skill
covers **doing actions on-chain** and **writing code against the SDKs**.

## Decide the Path: ACT vs BUILD

**ACT — the user wants an outcome on-chain now** → use the **meteora-invent studio CLI**
(config-driven JSONC, `dryRun` simulation, devnet parity). Covers launches, migrations, pool
creation, seeding, vaults, locks — and swaps, position/status reads, and DLMM fee claims on every
protocol.

**BUILD — the user wants code, or a flow the studio doesn't have** → use the **SDKs directly** with
the pinned versions above. Required for: bots, backends, UIs, DLMM add/remove/rebalance on existing
positions, CP-AMM position ops on arbitrary pools, and anything else not exposed as a studio action.

## Protocol Decision Tree

```
New token to launch?
├─ Yes → DBC (bonding curve → auto-graduates to DAMM v2 by default)
│        Fair-launch allocation needed on the post-launch pool? → + Alpha Vault
│        Raise before any pool exists? → Presale Vault
└─ No, token already exists
   ├─ Passive/simple pool, position NFTs, fee scheduler → DAMM v2
   ├─ Concentrated liquidity, active strategy, limit orders → DLMM
   └─ Existing DAMM v1 pool / Stake2Earn farm → DAMM v1 (do not start new projects here)
```

## Intake: Collect Before Any On-Chain Write

Never guess these. Ask the owner (or read from an existing config) and restate what you will do
before doing it:

| Item            | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Network         | Ask. Default **devnet** for first runs. Mainnet requires the gate below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| RPC URL         | Default public endpoint for the chosen network; recommend Helius/QuickNode/Triton for mainnet. Config `rpcUrl`, never hardcoded in code.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Wallet          | Ask: new wallet or existing? Either way the studio needs `PRIVATE_KEY` (base58) in `studio/.env` — `generate-keypair` only CONVERTS it to `studio/keypair.json` (+ optional devnet `--airdrop`); it does not create keys. New-wallet recipe: `studio-actions.md` §generate-keypair. Never print, log, or commit a private key. |
| Funding         | Pool creation ~0.05 SOL, launches ~0.1 SOL recommended. Check first (`solana balance <PUBKEY> -u devnet`, or `connection.getBalance`); on devnet airdrop, on mainnet ask the owner to fund and confirm.                                                                                                                        |
| Amounts & units | Confirm token units vs lamports for every amount (studio configs use human units — except the presale-vault block, where supply and caps are raw base/quote units; SDKs use lamports/BN. This is the #1 footgun — trust each config field's comment).                                                                          |
| Addresses       | Any pubkey the owner must control (feeClaimer, leftoverReceiver, creator, recipient): ask, don't default silently.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Protocol params | Use the flow's intake contract in its reference file (e.g. DBC launch contract in `references/dbc.md`), applying documented defaults for anything unstated.                                                                                                                                                                    |

**Gates (non-negotiable):**

1. First execution of any state-changing flow runs with `"dryRun": true` (ACT) or a simulation/quote
   (BUILD); show the owner the result. For actions that generate a fresh keypair (lock escrow,
   fee-sharing vault, stake2earn unstake account, zap position), the address a dry run prints is a
   throwaway placeholder — only save the address the real (`dryRun: false`) run prints.
2. Mainnet + real execution only after the owner explicitly confirms in this conversation.
3. After executing, verify on-chain (see Verification) and report addresses, costs, and next steps.
   Never claim success without verifying.

## ACT Quick Start (studio CLI)

```bash
# 0. Bootstrap: the toolkit is the meteora-invent repo
git clone https://github.com/MeteoraAg/meteora-invent && cd meteora-invent  # skip if present
pnpm install

# 1. Wallet: put PRIVATE_KEY (base58) in studio/.env — generate-keypair CONVERTS it
#    to studio/keypair.json (it does not create keys; new-wallet recipe in
#    references/studio-actions.md §generate-keypair)
pnpm studio generate-keypair --network devnet --airdrop

# 2. Configure by EDITING the protocol's fixed config file:
#    studio/config/<protocol>_config.jsonc (rpcUrl, dryRun, keypairFilePath,
#    computeUnitPriceMicroLamports, + protocol blocks). There is NO flag to pass a
#    different config file — flags only select targets (--baseMint / --poolAddress).
#    Commented templates identical to the real files: references/configs/*.jsonc

# 3. Dry-run (dryRun: true), review, flip to false, execute
pnpm studio <action> [--baseMint <MINT> | --poolAddress <POOL>]
```

All 81 actions with their real flags, config blocks, and outputs: `references/studio-actions.md`.
Environment details and wallet import: `references/studio-setup.md`.

## BUILD Quick Start (SDKs)

Read the protocol reference pack first, then write code against the pinned SDK versions in the
Product Map (`npm install <pkg>@<pinned>` in a fresh project OUTSIDE the monorepo; run TypeScript
with `npx ts-node`, not tsx). Universal rules — all four SDKs:

1. **web3.js v1 only** (`Connection`, `Transaction`, `PublicKey`, `Keypair`). Never `@solana/kit` /
   web3.js v2 types.
2. **Anchor split:** DBC, DAMM v2, DLMM use Anchor **0.31**; DAMM v1 uses Anchor **0.29**. Don't mix
   DAMM v1 with the others in one package without dependency isolation.
3. **Everything returns unsigned transactions** — you attach blockhash, fee payer, and signers, then
   send. Some methods return `Transaction[]` or `{ transaction, keypairs }` (extra signers!) — check
   the reference before assuming a single `Transaction`.
4. **`CollectFeeMode` is a different enum in each SDK.** Never carry enums across packages.
5. **Amounts are `BN` in base units (lamports).** Convert with the token's decimals.
6. **Refresh before quoting:** DLMM `refetchStates()`, DAMM v1 `updateState()`; fetch fresh pool
   state in DBC/DAMM v2.
7. Pin the versions from the Product Map; the references document those exact APIs and the breaking
   changes around them ("version fences"). If installed versions are newer, check the SDK's
   CHANGELOG before trusting a snippet.

## Safety Invariants

- Devnet first; dry-run/simulate first; smallest viable amounts on first mainnet run.
- Verify every address the owner gives you on the explorer before using it.
- Secrets only in `.env` / keypair files; never in code, output, or commits.
- Set `computeUnitPriceMicroLamports` (studio) or a compute-budget instruction (SDK) — unprioritized
  transactions fail on busy mainnet.
- Slippage: set explicit `slippageBps`/min-out on every swap; never 0 or unlimited.

## Operating Rules

1. **Never fabricate progress.** Don't claim a transaction was sent, a pool was created, or fees
   were claimed unless you have a real signature or re-read on-chain state. If the runtime has no
   network/execution access, stop and hand the owner the exact commands to run locally instead.
2. **Key hygiene.** Never ask the owner to paste a raw private key or seed phrase into chat; never
   print secret values; refer to wallets by public address and to keys by file path or env-var name
   only.
3. **Fresh context policy.** The reference packs track the pinned SDK versions in the Product Map.
   If the installed version is newer, read the SDK's CHANGELOG/`docs.md` before trusting a snippet;
   fetched source beats this skill — follow it and note the mismatch. Deep, always-current
   reference: every docs.meteora.ag page serves raw markdown (index:
   https://docs.meteora.ag/llms.txt), and the docs are also exposed as a live MCP server at
   `https://docs.meteora.ag/mcp` — connect it when your runtime supports MCP for searchable, current
   documentation.
4. **Reuse what the owner already said.** Fill intake from their message first; ask only for missing
   required fields; confirm any normalization (addresses, amounts, units) before executing.

## Verification

After every state-changing action:

1. Confirm the transaction signature landed: explorer link `https://solscan.io/tx/<SIG>` (append
   `?cluster=devnet` on devnet) or `connection.confirmTransaction`.
2. Re-read state and check the expected change:
   - DBC: `pnpm studio dbc-get-status --baseMint <MINT>` (progress, migrated, reserves, fees) or
     `client.state.getPoolByBaseMint(mint)`.
   - DAMM v2: `cpAmm.fetchPoolState(pool)` / `getUserPositionByPool(pool, user)`.
   - DLMM: `dlmm.refetchStates()` → `getActiveBin()`, `getPositionsByUserAndLbPair(user)`.
   - DAMM v1: `pool.updateState()` → `poolInfo`, `getUserBalance(owner)`.
3. Report to the owner: what executed, tx signature(s), created addresses (mint, pool, position,
   config), cost in SOL, and the next step in the flow.
