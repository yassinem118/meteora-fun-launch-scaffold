# Trigger Evals — `meteora` skill

Prompt set for testing whether the skill loads when it should (and stays quiet when it shouldn't),
per the Agent Skills description-testing methodology (~30 prompts, 3 runs each, trigger-rate ≥ 0.5
for should-trigger, ≤ 0.1 for should-not). Re-run whenever `SKILL.md` frontmatter (name/description)
changes.

## How to run

For each prompt, start a fresh agent session with the skill installed and check whether the runtime
loads/invokes the `meteora` skill. Record trigger rate over 3 runs. Claude Code: watch for the skill
appearing in context; OpenClaw: `openclaw agent --message "<prompt>"`; Hermes:
`hermes chat --toolsets skills -q "<prompt>"`.
